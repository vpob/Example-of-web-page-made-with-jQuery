Here is an example of page, made with jQuery
the main requirements are:

* Mark up the page as in the example, using any template. Not sure exactly comply with the dimensions important to have all the elements.
* Display a picture;
* Make the button "Display sales history"
* By clicking on the button "Display sales history," to show a list of sales, grouped by date.
* Within each group to display a list of goods sold (the default is minimized).
